## 0x05. Python - Exceptions

*An understanding of Syntax Errors and Exceptions.*

Syntax errors are also known as parsing errors that is violation of the language's rules regarding the structure and format of statements.

These errors occur when the interpreter cannot understand the code due to incorrect syntax.

Exceptions are errors detected during execution even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct. Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. They indicate that something unexpected has happened that prevents the program from continuing its usual execution path.
